=========================================

Parameters:
    resampling_strategy   : The resampling strategy to use to mitigate effects of class imbalance.
                            Choice of strategies are:
                            UpsampleToMax  - This resamples the training instances of each class to be equal to the class 
                                             with the maximum number of instances.
                                             E.g. If the training set had this class frequency: 
                                                     (Phone: 10, Address: 3, Name: 6, Unknown: 8)
                                                  This strategy would upsample each class to have 10 instances each:
                                                     (Phone: 10, Address: 10, Name: 10, Unknown: 10)
                            UpsampleToMean - This strategy upsamples only classes whose instances have less than the mean.
                                             E.g. From (Phone: 10, Address: 3, Name: 6, Email: 3, Unknown: 8) to
                                                       (Phone: 10, Address: 6, Name: 6, Email: 6, Unknown: 8)
                            ResampleToMean - Similar to "UpsampleToMean" but downsamples classes whose number of instances 
                                             is more than the mean.
                                             E.g. From (Phone: 10, Address: 3, Name: 6, Email: 3, Unknown: 8) to
                                                       (Phone: 6, Address: 6, Name: 6, Email: 6, Unknown: 6)
                            UpsampleToMedian - Similar to "UpsampleToMean" but uses the median instead.
                                             E.g. From (Phone: 10, Address: 2, Name: 7, Email: 3, Unknown: 8) to
                                                       (Phone: 10, Address: 7, Name: 7, Email: 7, Unknown: 8)
                            ResampleToMedian - Similar to "ResampleToMean" but uses the median instead.
                                             E.g. From (Phone: 10, Address: 2, Name: 7, Email: 3, Unknown: 8) to
                                                       (Phone: 7, Address: 7, Name: 7, Email: 7, Unknown: 7)
                            CapUnknownToHalf - Uses the actual number of instances, but sets the maximum proportion of 
                                               'unknown' instances to 50% of the whole training set.
                            NoResampling     - Just uses the actual number of instances per class.  Warning: number of 
                                               'unknown' class instances can be too large!
                            Bagging - This strategy increases the training set by creating numBags (default=100)
                                      instances per column with bagSize (default=100) randomly picked (with replacement)
                                      rows from this column.
                            BaggingToMax - Does the same as Bagging, and additionally resamples the training instances
                                           of each class to be equal to the class with the maximum number of instances.
                            BaggingToMean - Does the same as Bagging, and additionally resamples the training instances
                                           of each class to be equal to the mean (does either downsample or upsample).

Bagging is performed also at the prediction stage.
