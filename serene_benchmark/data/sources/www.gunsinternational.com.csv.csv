This listing is for  THREE  grip adapters assemblies. Hit Buy it, and youre buying 3, and not one. This does NOT include any magazine. We have magazine photos to assist with assembly. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras at the same per-assembly price and with no additional shipping charges. Here is a piece we installed a lot of back in the 1980s and early 1990s, Precision Gun Specialties grip adapter that makes a full size 5906 or 5900 type Smith  Wesson magazine fit the venerable 6906 or 6900 type Smith  Wesson Metal Frame Compact 9mms; they work perfectly on the older 469 and 669 Mini SWs as well. These will also fit the current production fifteen round Mec-Gar magazines numbers SW5915B and SW5915N. They will NOT work for Mec-Gar numbers 5910 and 5917, however. The tail pieces are different from the factory mags on the tens and seventeen rounders made by Mec-Gar, but the Mec-Gar fifteens are the same as the factory Smith  Wessons. No One regards the 6900 Smith  Wessons more highly than we do, but their compactness renders them less than ergonomic for protracted firing sessions, especially for folks like some of us with hands like Gatemouth Browns. These outfits have always been popular with law enforcement officers who carry them for backup in tactical situations, like drug agents who use the full capacity 6906 6946 type compacts and then have larger, but good feeling extra magazines. The adapters themselves are still manufactured by our old friends at Precision Gun Specialties; and they are relatively easy to install. We just remove the floorplate, install the adapter sleeve, and then slide in the PGS replacement floorplate. These adapters also work on 4000 series magazines, 4006 and 4003 mags, to fit into some variants of the 4013TSW and similar; the .40 compacts, though, have to be the ones capable of accepting double stacked magazines, not the single stacked ones like the old 4013 variants. Its literally just a snap to put one of these on the longer magazines. Single adapter price is $25.00. Were offering the adapters separately, however, in lots of 3 or more at only $19 each.

"","6,500.00","Layson","A fine original oil painting on canvas of Captain John Lewis Brooke MD CSA 13th Va. Regiment Co. D Louisa Blues. Painted in 1905 from a daugerotype photograph by Willis Pepoon. The actual painting measures 30 inches tall and 25 inches wide. The outside frame dimesions are 36 1 4 inches by 31 1 4 inches. The original photograph was taken the morning after the battle of Winchester, Va. July 1862. The painting remains in fine condition with no repairs or restoration. Capt. Brooke was a doctor for the 13th Va. Infantry Regiment. He was born in 1824 and died in 1869. The painting depicts Capt. Brooke in a relaxed pose in his Confederate uniform. His CSA buckle and buttons are easily identified in the painting. This painting was most likely commisioned by a family member in 1905. The 13th Va. Louisa Blues was part of the 16th Va. Cavalry as its nucleus... with prominent commanders of Colonels George A. Goodman, Ambrose P. Hill, James B. Terrill, James A. Walker and Majors Charles T. Crittenden and John B. Sherrard...

They were present and fought at the battles of First Manassas, Jacksons Valley Campaign, Seven Days, Cold Harbor, Cedar Mountain, Cross Keys, Port Republic, Gaines Mill, Second Manassas, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Winchester, Cedar Creek among many others. The Volunteer force was gathered in 1861 commisioned at Harpers Ferry and comprised of men mainly from Winchester, Louisa, Culpeper and Hampshire Counties of Virginia. His father was also a doctor and previous family were from Fauquier County and Culpeper. There is a wealth of information online of the 13th Va. Regiment. Willis Pepoon was a noted American artist painter born 1859 died 1940 and a Washington DC native and was most known for his commisioned portraits. Paintings of his are in Museums including the Smithsonian, College of William  Mary, VMI. A fine historical painting with Confederate provenance.
