Gift of Mrs. Herman C. Krannert             Learn More             Debt resulting from an inability to manage money kept Gilbert Stuart on the move much of his life. Born in             North Kingston, Rhode Island and raised in Newport, Stuart was taught by a local Scottish painter who took             him to Scotland, but his mentors death forced Stuart back to America. During the Revolutionary War, he             returned to England to study with the American expatriate Benjamin West. As success came, so did debt which             forced Stuart to Dublin, Ireland and then to America, where he eventually became the most highly regarded             portraitist of his day. A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas, without using             any preliminary drawing. By the end of his career, Stuart had painted over a thousand portraits of important             political figures. One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the Athenaeum Head currently             on the dollar bill.             In this painting, the woman and children are posed against a drawn drape in the style of British             portraiture. The similarity of the colors used in the sash, chair, curtain and trim on the young boys             jacket move the viewers eye around the canvas to encompass all the figures. The woman is wearing a simple,             elegant, robe  langlaise, a gown favored by portrait painters of the period. The womans hair is lightly             powdered and fashionably styled in the coiffure  l'hrisson, or hedgehog, in which the hair was cut short             in the front, frizzed to the ends and then brushed up away from the face.
