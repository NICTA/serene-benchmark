Many of the American painters who studied in Italy during the mid-nineteenth century included costumed figures in their landscape paintings. Ten years after Kensett left Rome, American artists were continuing the practice, demonstrated by the costume studies by Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902) illustrated below.","John Frederick Kensett","http:  emuseum.huntington.org internal media dispatcher 18168 resize:format$003dfull","NA","Standing Woman with Water Jug","American","1816","1872","ca. 1845 - 1847"

Gift of Margery and Maurice Katz","watercolor and graphite on paper","Charles Demuth is best known for his dynamic paintings of fire engines and grain elevators done in a Precisionist style similar to that of Charles Sheeler (whose work is on view elsewhere in this gallery). However, he also loved New York and adopted the city's nightlife as one of his subjects. In Vaudeville: Two Men he used vivid colors and a sensuous, fluid style to depict a painted backdrop and suggest the movement of two dancers from a variety show. A deft stroke of the artist's pencil gives the dancer on the left a witty wink.","Charles Demuth","http:  emuseum.huntington.org internal media dispatcher 21517 resize:format$003dfull","NA","Vaudeville: Two Men","American","1883","1935","ca. 1916"

Many of the American painters who studied in Italy during the mid-nineteenth century included costumed figures in their landscape paintings. Ten years after Kensett left Rome, American artists were continuing the practice, demonstrated by the costume studies by Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902) illustrated below.","John William Casilear","http:  emuseum.huntington.org internal media dispatcher 18192 resize:format$003dfull","NA","Woman with Water Jug","American","1811","1893","1842"
