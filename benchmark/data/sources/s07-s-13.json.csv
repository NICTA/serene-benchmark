In 1897, she gave a large part of her collection to the museum at the University of Pennsylvania (now the University Museum). Eakins very likely hoped that his grand portrait would be acquired by the university to hang with her donation. The university did accept the painting on loan, but eventually returned it to the artist after Eakins removed it repeatedly to send to other exhibitions.","http:  www.philamuseum.org images cad large 1929-184-16after-CX.jpg","Oil on canvas","American","Made in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, North and Central America","50 1 8 x 39 7 8 inches (127.3 x 101.3 cm)","Between Rounds","1898-99"

Swaying under the weight of her pail and squinting into the sun, she presents the ideal of natural womanhood. Her powerful presence, marked by broad shoulders, muscular arms, and sunburned skin, counters the farmhand's relaxed stance and shaded face, visually reversing traditional gender roles. Far from flirting, the two figures awkwardly avoid each other's gaze, modeling rural wholesomeness and rectitude.","http:  www.philamuseum.org images cad large 1953-111-1-CX.jpg","Oil on canvas","American","Made in United States, North and Central America","97 x 72 inches (246.4 x 182.9 cm)","Barn Swallows","1878"

Homer visited the Adirondacks as one of many vacationers who flocked there in the late nineteenth century.

Posey traced the gymnasts on this quilt from a pantyhose advertisement; she copied the central figure in a coat from another advertisement. She learned to quilt from her grandmother, a former slave, and continued to quilt throughout her life. She remembered that during her childhood piecing and quilting were community activities. Families would get together to tear up old clothes and overalls for quilt tops and on Sunday mornings the women would gather at one house to quilt.","http:  www.philamuseum.org images cad large 1966-205-49-50(10)-pdp.jpg","Photogravure","American","Photograph taken in Connecticut, United States, North and Central America","Image (sight): 8 5 8 x 10 15 16 inches (21.9 x 27.8 cm)","Abstraction, Porch Shadows, Twin Lakes, Connecticut","1915 (negative); 1917 (photogravure)"
